# memup

Memup is a language learning tool, primarily focused on japanese for the moment as this is what I'm learning.

Check out the [demo](https://pitilezard.github.io/memup/)

I know a lot of these tools exist here and there, but:

1.  I couldn't find one with all the features I wanted
2.  I kinda like coding this one so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Install & run

If you want to have this running on your machine, particiapte in coding this or if you're just curious:

Probably works with yarn/npm and all these but I use pnpm:

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Parcel skips a lot of TS stuff to make it faster, so typechecking is done on build or you can run:

```
pnpm types
```

Running tests is easy too:

```
pnpm test
```

# memup

Memup is a language learning tool, primarily focused on japanese for the moment as this is what I'm learning.

Status update, currently I have a little over 1000 japanese mems, currating the list and grouping it, reporting the vocab from books and websites is a lot longer than I anticipated. Also, I'm learning them in the meantime so there's that too. I'll make all of that public eventually. My goal is to have 6000 mems or around, but around 2000 I'll work on sharing all this in the most ideal way. Meanwhile, I'll fix whatever is annoying in my studying process, and increase feature here and there. If you're into this app, tell me, I'd like to hear from you ;)

Check out the [demo](https://pitilezard.github.io/memup/)

I know a lot of these tools exist here and there, but:

1.  I couldn't find one with all the features I wanted
2.  I kinda like coding this one so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Install & run

If you want to have this running on your machine, particiapte in coding this or if you're just curious:

Probably works with yarn/npm and all these but I use pnpm:

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Parcel skips a lot of TS stuff to make it faster, so typechecking is done on build or you can run:

```
pnpm types
```

Running tests is easy too:

```
pnpm test
```

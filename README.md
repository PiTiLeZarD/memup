# memup

Check out the [demo](https://pitilezard.github.io/memup/)

I used to enjoy memrise, and it's changed quite a bit since I've used it. So I'm doing my own. I'm learning japanese so you'll have a lot of japanese specific stuff in here.

## Install & run

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## TODO

-   all of the data collected during learn/quizz will automatically give a difficulty score to each mem and process how often you should be reviewing them
-   Will make some category/tags/folder thingy at some point
-   import/export categories and possibility to export stripping checks
-   import should have an option to merge sets, ID matching and all
-   graphs and all! Giving you knowledge on how/how much you learn and such
-   I'll provide my learning material at some point
-   so many ideas tho!
